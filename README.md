# Credit Risk Resampling
Supervised Learning

## Summary
This project was an effort to understand how resampling data can have a great effect on the outcome of a machine learning algorithm. Resampling can be an invaluable tool when working with data sets that are unbalanced as well as the results of the machine learning algorithm are expected to be unbalanced. In this example the risk of any one individual being flagged as a credit risk is very small, the model still needs to account for the possibility. Without resampling, the model could be insufficiently trained and thus have a lower utility in trying to predict this event.
